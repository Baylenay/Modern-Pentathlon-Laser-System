# Modern-Pentathlon-Laser-System

This system allows Modern Pentathletes to train for the combined run-shoot element of Modern Pentathlon. Since 2012, laser pistols have been used in competition which make the sport safer especially given that running is involved too. However, it requires more complicated technology in order to identify shots. In this discipline, the athlete has a maximum time of 50s to hit the black of the target 5 times before running 800m. This run-shoot combination is repeated 3 more times meaning 3200m is completed in total. This system uses a camera to visualise the laser pulses on the target and then OpenCV running on a Raspberry Pi to decode the image and identify where exactly the laser pulse is. The controller is an app either on a smartphone or tablet. The app has a training and competition mode with a stopwatch. Shots are displayed on an image of the target which can then be saved to Dropbox with a timestamp, so analysis can be performed post training. There are 5 Red/Green LEDs on the target that start red and light up consecutively after each time the black of the target is hit. When the 50s is up or the 5 LEDs are green, the lights reset to red. After 40s the LEDs flash and then again more frequently after 45s to notify the shooter time is running out. The connection between the app and the target is enabled by UDP.
